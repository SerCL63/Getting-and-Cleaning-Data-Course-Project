# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

The tidy data set's structure is described in the [Data](#data) section, the variables are described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the transformations that were made to obtain the data set are listed in the [Transformations](#transformations) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `tidy_data.txt` is a text file, with specific values.

The first row has all the variable names, described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the next rows have the values for these same variables. 

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer values, goes from 1-30.

- `activity`

	Identifies the nature of each activity, and has 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: The subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`:  The subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: The subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: The subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: The subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: The subject was laying

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>

All measurements are individual point values, and were bounded inside [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration values were measured in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope values were measured in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals obtained through the accelerometer and gyroscope.

- Frequency-domain signals obtained from applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
1. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings `mean` and `std`) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
1. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see [Identifiers](#identifiers) section).
1. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` was expanded to `timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX`), using the following set of rules:
	- Special characters (i.e. `(`, `)`, and `-`) were removed
	- The initial `f` and `t` were expanded to `frequencyDomain` and `timeDomain` respectively.
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` were replaced with `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
	- Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's `features_info.txt` file) `BodyBody` with `Body`.
1. From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script (see `README.md` file for usage instruction
